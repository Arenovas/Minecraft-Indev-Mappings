# Minecraft-Indev-Mappings
Java Mappings and Patch File for Minecraft Indev 02-23-2010

These mappings are made for use with Fabric's version of Enigma found here: https://maven.fabricmc.net/cuchaz/enigma/
Mappings made on 0.14.3.147.

Simply open it up, select the Indev 02-23-2010 jar and then open the mappings using Enigma Directory.

Once it's been loaded, export the source files. Then remove the Paulscode folder and /com/jcraft folder. After all that is done, apply the patch file.

Do feel free to make pull requests to help update the mappings and patch file further since there's still bound to be various inaccuracies and bugs hiding away.
